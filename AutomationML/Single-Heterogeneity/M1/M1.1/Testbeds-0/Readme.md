This is an example for Value Transformation

There are two heterogenity files in this example generated from "seed.aml".

a) "seed-String-1.aml"
b) "seed-String-0.aml"

It contains the following conflicts:

1: pair (FlowchartNumber),(PipeWork FlowchartNumber)

2: pair (FlowchartNumber),(instrumentation flowchart)

One file has flowchart defined with pipework and instrmentation where other has the value concatinated.
