This is an example for Value Transformation

There are two heterogenity files in this example generated from "seed.aml".

a) "seed-String-1.aml"
b) "seed-String-0.aml"

It contains the following conflicts:

1: pair (PCEFunction),(PCE initial)

2: pair (PCEFunction),(PCEFunction)

One file has PCEFunction defined with function  and catagory initial where other has the value concatinated.
